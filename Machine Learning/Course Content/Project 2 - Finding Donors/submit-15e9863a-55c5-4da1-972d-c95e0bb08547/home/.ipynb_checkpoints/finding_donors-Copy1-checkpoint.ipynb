    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "__Answer:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "__Support Vector Machines:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "-  Support vector machines (SVM) are very much used in the field of Bioinformatics. One large real world application for this model is to predict the 3D structure of a protein sequence based off of the amino acid sequence itself. The model has some postive results in this field and (Markowetz, 2003) shows how SVM can out perform other classification methods. The paper also shows how well SVM can deal with higher dimonsional spaces and infact entering these spaces yeilds more positive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Support vector machines can solve non-linear relationships between the data points. This means the boundary it creates does not have to be a straight line and therefore the model can be used to effectively classify more complex data sets. Support vector machines always deliver a unique solution. This can be an advantage as we will not have multiple solutions associated to local minima thus making SVMs more robust over different samples (Auria & Moro, 2008). Due to being able to deal with complex scenarios this costs resource so SVMs thrives in smaller data sets as opposed to larger ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Support vector machines have lots of praise for their ability to predict complicated relationships but this comes at a cost. The transparency of the results is lost due to the fact that the dimension can be very high (Auria & Moro, 2008). As mentioned before it costs alot of computational resource, espicially as the data sets get larger and larger so in scenarios like this it could be better to use a different model.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Support vector machines are often used for classification problems so that makes them a good candidate for this task of trying to classify potential donors. In terms of what we know about the data, the data set isnt too large and as long as we set up the correct parameters i believe the SVM will perform well due to the variables given.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Logistic Regression:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "-  Logistic regression has been used many times in the world of medicine to help classify diseases based off our symptons. One example of this was a study done in 2009 that shows a logistic regression model out performing professional Radiologists in the detection of breast cancer. The results are quite amazing with logstic regression achieving up to a 96% sensitivity (recall) score compared to the Radiologists 88% (Chhatwal et al., 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Logistic regression works by linearly splitting the data (drawing a straight line through the data set). This means the model performs well on data that can be linearly seperated. A strength is that the outputs are easy to inteprate as a probability is given (elitedatascience.com, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "-  A weakness to logistic regression models, and where SVM's can come in handy, is where the relationship between the data is more complex. This is because the solution would require a non-linear line or multiple boundary lines (elitedatascience.com, 2019). This weakness would cause the model to perform badly in data sets that have a complex relationship or behave in a non-linear way.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  From the data set given I beleive logistic regression could be a good candidate. One reason for this is that the data set is skewed and therefore my hypothesis is that one or two variables with a key value could be the difference between earning over or under 50,000 dollars. Logistic regression might be able to easily seperate the data on that key tipping point. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Decision Trees:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "-  Decision trees are also used in the field of medicine to help diagnose patients. One online reports looks into how decision tree's are used to help nurses make decisions (nursingtimes.net, 2019). Decision tree's helped nurses make decisions in more complicated scenarios and also helped to show the patients and thier families the different options and what the likley result would be based of the choices made. The use of decision tree's in nursing spans further back you might think with a study showing nurses who used decision trees had a high diagnostic accuracy, this was back in 1979 (Aspinall, 1979). \n",
    "\n",
    "-  One strength of decision tree's is that they have the ability to learn non-linear relationships in the data. This is done by splitting the data over and over again following a path of certain criterias. Decision tree's also handle outliers well but a key strength, espicially when used in a working enviroment, is that decision tree's are easy to interpret and share with other people (simafore.com, 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "-  One disadvantage to basic decisions tree's is that they are prone to just completely memorising the data set and therefore over fitting. This can be helped by ensemble methods or setting up the right parameters (simaefore.com, 2019). Decision trees can perform badly if left unconstrained and over fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "-  Due to the decision tree's ability to deal with outliers well and non-linear relationships I dont not believe there are any key indicators from the data set that would indicate a decision tree would perform badly and therefore I think this a good candidate to use for the classification.\n",

    "Taking a look at the 6 graphs produced we can compare the 3 models and try to identify the most suitable for this scenario. \n",
    "First of all we can see a huge difference in training & testing time between the support vector machine and the other two models. For a working enviroment this difference could be a big disadvanatage, espicially if integrated into a system process. The other two models trained and predicted the data sets almost instantly. Looking at the accuracy scores between the models, the decision tree has a very high score on the training set and then the lowest score on the testing sign. This shows the model over fitted to the data set and is a common problem with decision trees. Logistic regression had the highest accuracy score on the testing set. The F scores for the models tell a similar story. Decision tree's having very high scores on the training set and then the lowest again on the testing set whilst logistic regression highest, only just. \n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, I believe the most appropriate model to use in this scenario is the logistic regression model. The model not only scored the highest but also had much stronger performance times than compared to the SVM. SVM scored very closely to the logistic regression and potentially with tuning of the parameters could score higher but due to performance this is not something I believe should be explored and instead energy should be spent on improving the logistic regresssion model. I believe the variables in the data set are sensible and should be related to what we are trying to predict so from this point of view I think the data set is suitable for logistic regression. Outliers can affect logistic regression but looking at the data set and how we have prepared the data I do not think this will be a big issue."

    "Logistic regression works by drawing a line through the dataset and then using this line to classify the \"Yes / No\" decision. Depending on what side of the line the data point lies upon will determine its prediction. This is done by taking all of the variables and using them to work out a probability of the event happening. This line is created by drawing a random line in the data set and seeing how much error there was in the classifications then, using a step by step process, the line moves around the data set to try and reduce the amount of errors. Once the most optimal line has been drawn the process stops and this is the boundary that will be used to predict each data point.  \n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "__1.__ Capital Gains: I believe capital gains to be the most important feature to prediciting whether or not someone earns more than 50,000. For every dollar earnt in capital gains is one less dollar the person needs to earn from their day job. In cases where capital gains exceeds 50,000 then we know for certainty that that person earns more than 50,000 a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2.__ Occupation: Next in the order i beleive is someones job. Same titled jobs often get paid similar salaries so we can gauge from job title what the highest paid jobs are and most people with that job probably earn similar amounts so this should be a key driver in prediciting how much someone earns per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "__3.__ Age: Next i believe age could be a key indicator in salary predicition. As people get older their gain promotions / pay rises as they progress through companies and become more valued employees. I believe there will be a correlation between age and pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4.__ Education: I hypothesis education will be next in the order of feature importance. People with a higher educational background might have the ability to land the better jobs and negotiate better salaries from the companies they are joining. This isnt always the case as there are always exceptions  but i think as a general rule this could be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "__5.__ Hours Worked: As we move away from the salaried jobs, who will all share a similar number of hours, we move into the self employed and other work streams hours worked could directly link to the amount of money earnt.

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
